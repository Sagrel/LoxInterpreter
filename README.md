# LoxInterpreter

This is a simple tokenizer, parser and interpreter for a basic version of the Lox language defined in [crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

I wrote this before the pandemic just to freshen up on my C++ and experiment with more involved class hierarchies and the visitor pattern.
